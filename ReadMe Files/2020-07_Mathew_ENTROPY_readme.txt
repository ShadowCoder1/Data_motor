Sex differences in visuomotor tracking. Scientific Reports (2020) 10:11863. https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-68069-0 (ENTROPY)

**Key results**
The paper analyzed approximate entropy (ApEn) as a measure of movement complexity and unpredictability during visuomotor tracking. No significant differences were found between males and females in ApEn values for either horizontal movements (M=0.52±0.04 vs F=0.52±0.04) or vertical movements (M=0.51±0.04 vs F=0.50±0.03). This suggests that both groups exhibited similar levels of movement complexity and predictability in their tracking patterns.

**Methods**
Approximate entropy (ApEn) was calculated to characterize the unpredictability of cursor motion signals during a visuomotor tracking task. Participants used a joystick to track a moving target on a screen. ApEn was analyzed separately for horizontal and vertical movement components. Higher ApEn values indicate more unpredictable/complex signals.

**Theory notes**
ApEn provides an index to characterize the complexity and unpredictability of time series data. In motor control, it helps quantify the regularity/predictability of movement patterns. The analysis aimed to determine if males and females differed in movement complexity during tracking.

**Assessments**
No cognitive assessments were used.

**Medical condition**  
No patient populations were used.

**Exclusion criteria**
12 participants were excluded to match age distributions between male and female groups. 9 additional participants were excluded for participating in multiple studies.

**Explanation of missing data**
N/A

**Participant demographics**
First cohort: 25 females (25.5±2.6 years) and 25 males (25.5±3.8 years)
Second cohort: 51 females (21.4±2.5 years) and 26 males (22.4±3.5 years)
All participants were right-handed.

**Experiment goal**
The study aimed to examine potential sex differences in movement complexity during visuomotor tracking by analyzing approximate entropy of cursor trajectories. This analysis would reveal if males and females employ different levels of movement predictability/regularity in their tracking strategies. The entropy analysis extends prior work by providing a detailed characterization of movement complexity beyond basic kinematic measures.
