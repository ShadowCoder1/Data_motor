Sex differences in visuomotor tracking. Scientific Reports (2020) 10:11863. https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-68069-0 (DATA_second_cohort)

**Key results**
The second cohort confirmed a male advantage in visuomotor tracking performance. The cursor-target distance was 13% greater in women than men (F=1.76±0.29 vs M=1.55±0.25 cm). Women showed a larger cursor-target lag compared to men (F=59±18 vs M=42±17 ms). When compensating for temporal delays, no sex differences remained in cursor-target distance. The male advantage in tracking accuracy persisted across all trials, indicating robustness of the effect.

**Methods**
Participants tracked a visual target moving in an unpredictable trajectory using a joystick-controlled cursor. The target followed pseudo-random 2D patterns generated by combining sinusoids. Each trial lasted 10s with the pattern repeating twice. Participants completed 10 baseline trials with randomized and counterbalanced pattern presentation. Only hand movements were recorded (no eye tracking) in this cohort. Instructions were to minimize cursor-target distance throughout each trial.

**Theory notes**
The study investigated sex differences in visuomotor processing and eye-hand coordination. The theoretical framework focused on understanding decisional processes linking visual information to motor actions and potential sex-based differences in visuomotor integration.

**Assessments**
No cognitive assessments were used.

**Medical condition**
No patient populations were used.

**Exclusion criteria**

**Participant demographics**
77 participants total (51 females; mean age 21.4±2.5 years; 26 males; mean age 22.4±3.5 years). All participants were right-handed with normal/corrected vision.

**Experiment goal**
The study aimed to test the robustness of previously observed sex differences in visuomotor tracking using a new cohort of naive participants. The goal was to understand whether males and females differ in their visuomotor processing speed and accuracy, specifically examining temporal aspects of performance. This extends prior work by focusing on the timing of hand movements relative to target motion.

**Special instructions**
Participants were instructed to keep the cursor as close as possible to the moving target throughout each trial.
