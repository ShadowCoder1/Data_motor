**Key results**
This dataset demonstrates a relationship between eye and hand tracking performance within male and female groups. The data shows that participants who exhibit accurate eye tracking also tend to show accurate manual tracking. However, there is an offset along the vertical axis (manual tracking) for both spatial and temporal errors, indicating this relationship holds separately for males and females. Despite similar gaze behavior between sexes, males showed better manual tracking performance. The data reconciles seemingly conflicting observations about sex differences in eye-hand coordination.

**Methods**
Participants performed a visuomotor tracking task where they had to keep a cursor as close as possible to a moving target using a joystick. Eye movements were recorded simultaneously. The target followed unpredictable 2D trajectories generated by combining sinusoids. Trials lasted 10 seconds each. Both spatial accuracy (cursor-target distance) and temporal accuracy (cursor-target lag) were measured for eye and hand movements. Cross-correlations were used to analyze the relationship between eye and hand tracking performance.

**Theory notes**
This dataset tests theories about eye-hand coordination and sex differences in visuomotor control. It examines whether better manual tracking performance in males stems from different gaze strategies or from differences in the speed of visuomotor processing.

**Assessments**
No cognitive assessments were used.

**Medical condition**
No patient populations were used.

**Exclusion criteria**
12 participants were excluded to match age distributions between male and female groups. Only right-handed participants with normal/corrected vision were included.

**Explanation of missing data**
N/A

**Participant demographics**
First cohort: 25 females (25.5 ± 2.6 years) and 25 males (25.5 ± 3.8 years)
Second cohort: 51 females (21.4 ± 2.5 years) and 26 males (22.4 ± 3.5 years)

**Experiment goal**
The experiment aimed to understand the relationship between eye and hand tracking performance and how this relationship might differ between males and females. It specifically investigated whether previously observed male advantages in manual tracking could be explained by differences in gaze behavior. The analysis sought to reconcile how males and females could show different levels of manual tracking skill while using similar gaze strategies.

**Special instructions**
Participants were instructed to keep the cursor as close as possible to the moving target throughout each trial.
