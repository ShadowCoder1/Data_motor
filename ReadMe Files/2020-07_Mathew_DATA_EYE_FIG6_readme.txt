**Key results**
This dataset shows that male and female participants exhibited nearly identical gaze behavior during a visuomotor tracking task. Specifically, there were no significant differences between males and females in eye-target distance, eye-target lag, saccade rate, or smooth pursuit gain. The data demonstrates that both groups maintained similar eye tracking performance and employed comparable gaze strategies, despite differences in manual tracking performance. This suggests that the male advantage in manual tracking does not stem from differences in visual monitoring or gaze control.

**Methods**
Participants performed a visuomotor tracking task where they had to track a moving target with their eyes while simultaneously controlling a cursor with a joystick. Eye movements were recorded using an infrared video-based eye tracker sampling at 1000 Hz. The target followed unpredictable 2D trajectories generated by combining sinusoidal motions. Trials lasted 10 seconds each, with participants completing 10 trials. The target moved with a mean tangential velocity of 16 cm/s along trajectories spanning 160 cm in path length.

**Theory notes**
This dataset tests theories about sex differences in visuomotor control and eye-hand coordination. It specifically examines whether previously observed male advantages in manual tracking could be explained by differences in gaze behavior or visual monitoring strategies.

**Assessments**
No cognitive assessments were used.

**Medical condition**
No patient populations were used.

**Exclusion criteria**
12 participants were excluded to match age distributions between male and female groups. Only right-handed participants with normal or corrected-to-normal vision were included.

**Explanation of missing data**
N/A

**Participant demographics**
First cohort: 25 females (25.5 ± 2.6 years) and 25 males (25.5 ± 3.8 years). All participants were right-handed.

**Experiment goal**
The study aimed to determine whether males and females employ different gaze strategies during visuomotor tracking. Given previous findings of male advantages in manual tracking, this analysis specifically investigated whether such advantages could be explained by differences in visual monitoring or eye movement control. This helps understand whether sex differences in tracking performance arise from differences in visual processing versus motor control.

**Special instructions**
Participants were instructed to maintain their head position using a chin and forehead rest. A mask prevented vision of their hands during the task.
