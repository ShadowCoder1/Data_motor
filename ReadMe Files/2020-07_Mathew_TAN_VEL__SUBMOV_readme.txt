Based on the provided research paper, I'll create a README file for the TAN_VEL__SUBMOV dataset. However, I notice that the paper doesn't explicitly mention "TAN_VEL__SUBMOV" - I'll focus on the tangential velocity and submovement aspects of the manual tracking task described.

**Key results**  
Analysis of tangential velocity and submovements revealed no significant differences between males and females in hand movement kinematics. Mean cursor tangential velocity was similar between men (18.5 ± 1.1 cm/s) and women (18.6 ± 1.4 cm/s). The number of submovements, based on tangential acceleration zero-crossings, was also similar between men (57.9 ± 5.9) and women (59.0 ± 6.5). Movement smoothness and complexity measures showed no key differences between sexes.

**Methods**  
Participants performed a visuomotor tracking task using a joystick to follow an unpredictably moving target on a screen. The task involved continuous tracking for 10s trials. Target motion followed pseudo-random 2D patterns generated by combining sinusoids. Tangential velocity and submovements were analyzed from cursor trajectories. Movement intermittency was assessed by counting zero-crossings in tangential acceleration.

**Theory notes**  
The analysis focused on examining whether sex differences in tracking performance could be explained by differences in movement kinematics, particularly smoothness and intermittency of hand movements.

**Assessments**  
No cognitive assessments were used.

**Medical condition**  
No patient populations were used.

**Exclusion criteria**  
12 participants were excluded to match age distributions between male and female groups. Participants who participated in multiple studies were excluded.

**Explanation of missing data**  
N/A

**Participant demographics**  
First cohort: 25 females (25.5 ± 2.6 years) and 25 males (25.5 ± 3.8 years)
Second cohort: 51 females (21.4 ± 2.5 years) and 26 males (22.4 ± 3.5 years)
All participants were right-handed.

**Experiment goal**  
The study aimed to understand whether sex differences in visuomotor tracking performance could be explained by differences in movement kinematics. Specifically, it examined if males exhibited smoother or less intermittent movements than females. This investigation extends prior work on sex differences in motor control by providing detailed analysis of movement characteristics.

**Special instructions**  
Participants were instructed to keep the cursor as close as possible to the moving target over the whole trial, minimizing cursor-target distance.
