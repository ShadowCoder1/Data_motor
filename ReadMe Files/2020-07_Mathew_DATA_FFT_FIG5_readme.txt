Sex differences in visuomotor tracking. Scientific Reports (2020) 10:11863. https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-68069-0 (DATA_FFT_FIG5)

**Key results**
Spectral analyses showed that the frequency content of cursor motion was largely determined by target motion, with no significant differences between male and female power spectra. Two-way ANOVAs revealed no main effect of SEX [F(1,48) < 0.015; p > 0.60] and no SEX by FREQUENCY interaction [F(17,816) < 0.01; p > 0.49]. The effect of FREQUENCY was significant [F(1,44) = 47.55; p < 0.001]. Analysis of cursor tangential velocity showed similar characteristics between men and women in both mean values and standard deviations. The data demonstrates that the male advantage in tracking accuracy was not due to differences in hand movement kinematics.

**Methods**
Participants performed a visuomotor tracking task where they controlled a cursor using a joystick to follow a moving target. The target followed pseudo-random 2D patterns generated by combining sinusoids. Five different patterns were used with mean tangential velocity of 16 cm/s. Each trial lasted 10s with patterns repeated twice. Spectral analyses were performed separately on horizontal and vertical cursor motions within 0-2 Hz frequency range. Cursor tangential velocity and its fluctuations were measured.

**Theory notes**
The study investigated potential sex differences in visuomotor tracking performance, specifically examining whether males and females employ different strategies in terms of hand movements. The spectral analyses aimed to characterize the frequency content of cursor motion to understand potential differences in visuomotor feedback loops.

**Assessments**
No cognitive assessments were used.

**Medical condition**
No patient populations were used.

**Exclusion criteria**
12 participants were excluded to match age distributions between male and female groups. Only right-handed participants with normal/corrected vision were included.

**Explanation of missing data**
N/A

**Participant demographics**
First cohort: 25 females (25.5 ± 2.6 years) and 25 males (25.5 ± 3.8 years)
Second cohort: 51 females (21.4 ± 2.5 years) and 26 males (22.4 ± 3.5 years)

**Experiment goal**
The study aimed to understand whether the previously observed male advantage in manual tracking stemmed from differences in hand movement kinematics. The spectral analyses specifically examined whether men and women employed different movement strategies or control mechanisms during tracking. This analysis helps determine if tracking performance differences were due to movement execution versus other factors like processing speed.

**Special instructions**
Participants were instructed to minimize the cursor-target distance throughout each trial. They were informed this distance would be used to assess their tracking performance.
