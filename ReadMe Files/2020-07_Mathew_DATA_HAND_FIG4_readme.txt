**Key results**
This dataset shows significant sex differences in manual tracking performance. Males demonstrated better tracking accuracy with smaller cursor-target distances (1.62 cm vs 1.80 cm for females). The key finding was that females exhibited a larger temporal lag between hand motion and target motion (63 ms vs 48 ms for males). After compensating for this temporal lag, the spatial accuracy differences between males and females disappeared. This suggests the male advantage stems from faster visuomotor processing rather than differences in movement strategies or gaze behavior.

**Methods**
Participants used a joystick to track a moving visual target (blue disk, 0.5 cm diameter) with a cursor (red disk, 0.5 cm diameter) on a screen positioned 57 cm away. The target followed unpredictable 2D trajectories generated by combining sinusoidal motions. Each trial lasted 10 seconds with the target completing two full pattern cycles. Participants were instructed to minimize the cursor-target distance throughout each trial. Head movements were restrained using a chin rest.

**Theory notes**
This study investigated sex differences in visuomotor control, specifically examining whether male advantages in tracking stem from differences in movement strategies, gaze behavior, or speed of visuomotor processing. The work contributes to understanding sex-based differences in sensorimotor integration and decision-making.

**Assessments**
No cognitive assessments were used.

**Medical condition**
No patient populations were used.

**Exclusion criteria**
12 participants were excluded to match age distributions between male and female groups. Only right-handed participants with normal/corrected vision were included.

**Explanation of missing data**
N/A

**Participant demographics**
Total N=127 participants (after age matching: 25 females, mean age 25.5±2.6 years; 25 males, mean age 25.5±3.8 years)

**Experiment goal**
The study aimed to characterize sex differences in visuomotor tracking and identify their underlying mechanisms. Figure 4 specifically examined whether males and females differ in spatial accuracy (cursor-target distance), temporal precision (cursor-target lag), and residual spatial error after lag compensation. This analysis helped determine if sex differences stemmed from movement strategies or processing speed.

**Special instructions**
Participants were instructed to keep the cursor as close as possible to the moving target throughout each trial.
